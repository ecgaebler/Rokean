# Rokean
Another language project, this time influenced by Korean phonetics.
I wanted to get some practice with C/C++ while revisiting my interest in linguistics. When completed, this program should generate the vocabulary for a new agglutinative synthetic language, given a list of English words and a list of syllables to build words from. While I chose to base Rokean in part on Korean, I designed this program to be more flexible and reuseable than my previous project, Katanese. 
use command "make" to compile from source.
